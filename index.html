									<p>Like most of my presentations at high schools and universities, themes of self-acceptance, owning one's own life story, and the appreciation of differences in the communities in which we live. Simply by telling my own story - a journey towards self-acceptance - students get to reflect on their own journies and what a powerful opportunity it is to work on self love and appreciation. It's the perfect antidote to bullying and negativity in our schools.</p>

								<h6>March 25, 2013</h6>
								<p><a href="http://madeleinemaguire.com/"> Madeleine Maguire</a> and I teamed up with <a href="http://clevejones.com/">Cleve Jones</a> to create a march that drew attention to the important decision that the Supreme Court of the United States was about to make as they review Prop 8 and DOMA. We gathered a team of newly minted youth activists that worked together for several months creating one of the most beautiful marches in recent years. On the evening of March 25, over 5,000 people joined together to march, rally, raise their voices, and declare to the world that nothing less than equality was acceptable. It was a huge success and gift to the city of San Francisco. For video of me emceeing the rally, click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzz4ITxNado">here</a> </p>

									<h6>Behavioral Health Clinician at <a href="http://www.jri.org/" target="_new">Jri Health</a></h6>
									<p>"Gregg has a special talent to create a warm, embracing, safe space where people feel supported and accepted as who they are.  During the 5 days at Arts in the Woods, and also beyond those 5 days, we as a community have felt connected and intimate in an indescribable way.  It feels as though I have finally found the queer home that I had been longing for and had almost given up to find.  I have no doubt that Gregg played a critical role for me and for many others to find the home. Gregg took many risks over the 5 days and demonstrated that he was completely with us.   He shared a very personal story of his with us, had long, late evening conversations with us, and pushed us enough to trust each other and share our stories from the very first day. Gregg is brave, caring, thoughtful, loving, tender, and strong. He knows how to trust people and also knows how to teach people to trust one another, which is something many of us struggled to do for years, or never thought possible.  I am extremely thankful to have met him and am thrilled to witness more miracles with Gregg."</p>

									<p>"You immediately engaged people from all walks of life (homeless, permanently housed, lesbians, gays, transgender, black communities, Latinos, and so many others) in a genuine way. 

You used your conflict resolution skills, challenged the young people to think differently, and allowed them to express their anger and differences in a very supporting and caring way. This allowed everyone to feel safe in a challenging situation. What was most admirable was your ability to make people feel loved and heard. 
As you facilitated the large groups, you were clear, fostered open participation with respect to youth culture, norms, and the participants' diversity. You demonstrated effective verbal communication skills. You developed rapport with participants, and practiced active listening. You gave people feedback about what was said, you provided a brief summary when needed, and you made time for those who may have not said enough.
What was most impressive was your ability to honor and recognize and ensure inclusiveness. You were able to provide a climate of safety and trust and embraced all different learning styles. 
The most important part of what you brought to the retreat was your genuine and caring heart. You spoke from the heart and when people do that, its never wrong. You've been touched in a way - that was clear, and your openness is a true testament to the passion within you.</p>

									<h6>Author, <i>One Moment Meditation: Stillness for People on the Go</i></h6>
									<p>"Gregg Cassin is a truly masterful facilitator. He is not one of those slick or over-polished personalities. Rather, he is genuine, warm, and humble—with a  wicked sense of humor that puts people at their ease.  He makes people feel that he is 'one of us.' He has that ability—so rare among professional facilitators—to speak from his heart, respond to the real needs of a group <i>in the moment,</i> and make it safe for others to speak honestly. Indeed, I have never seen anyone who can help a group “open” so effectively, making it instantly safe for them to explore even sensitive issues with both kindness and compassion."</p>

									<p>“Gregg Cassin enchants you with his ability to point out the best and worst in us and still help you leave with a better appreciation of humanity and the in-your-face way which we must share our love with each other. He speaks from the heart, sharing personal stories of pain, love, and humor as well as mixing in poignant tales of human generosity and healing.
He is a magnet for those who need their story to be told or just to have someone say, “get off your ass and start your healing!” He helps us learn that we are all perfect because of our imperfections. He is the kind of guy that you want to have over for a slumber party so that you can have a mixture of spilling your deepest secrets and telling fart jokes till you throw-up from laughing too hard. Gregg has something for everyone!”</p>
